                    <p>Semantic technology and linked data are perceived by the IoT industry as beneficial technologies to enable semantic interoperability in the fragmented landscape of IoT ecosystems and platforms. However, most industrial practitioners are not familiar with these technologies and are not willing to learn them, as they believe the learning curve is too steep. IoT developers - whether device manufacturers or application developers - ask for rather simple ontologies that are easy to use, and clear guidelines on how to implement semantic web/ linked data solutions, possibly supported by standards development organizations (SDOs), whereas the information they can currently find on the Internet is overwhelming and perceived as not directly applicable. As we have often heard from industrial stakeholders in the past years, there is a clear need to bring semantic technology out of the research labs - where it has been successful so far - to be adopted and applied in operational environments by the IoT industry. Semantic Interoperability is a key issue on the Internet of Things, and several organizations develop ontologies to describe IoT devices and the data they exchange. (W3C SSN, W3C WoT, ETSI SmartM2M, ETSI ISG CIM, BAC.net, KNX, BRICK, …). We encourage these organizations to submit papers about their work.
                    </p>

                    <p>The main objective of this workshop is to bring SDOs and industrial practitioners in IoT with an interest in semantic interoperability together with the strong and successful research community at IoT 2018 to discuss current trends and challenges in Semantic Interoperability and Standardization in IoT. </p>

                    <p>The first edition of SIS-IoT was successfully held at SEMANTiCS 2017 during half a day. Five papers were presented, and there were approximately 25 attendees.</p>

The aim of this platform is to provide a complete traceability of the life cycle of the wine, from the winegrower to the consumer. In particular, Wine Cloud may qualify as an agricultural decision platform will be used for vine life cycle management in order to predict the occurrence of major risks (vine diseases, grape vine pests, physiological risks, fermentation stoppage, oxidation of vine, etc...). Also to make wine production more rational by offering winegrower a set of recommendation regarding their strategy's of production development. <br/>

The proposed platform "Wine Cloud" is based on heterogeneous sensors network (agricultural machines, plant sensors and measuring stations) deployed throughout a vineyard. These sensors allow for capturing data from the agricultural process and remote monitoring vineyards in the Internet of Things (IoT) era. However, the sensors data from different source is hard to work together for lack of semantic. Therefore, the task of coherently combining heterogeneous sensors data becomes very challenging. The integration of heterogeneous data from sensors can be achieved by data mining algorithms able to build correlations. Nevertheless, the meaning and the value of these correlations is difficult to perceive without highlighting the meaning of the data and the semantic description of the measured environment. 
 <br/>
In order to bridge this gap and built causality relationships form heterogeneous sensor data, we propose an ontology-based approach, that consists in exploring heterogeneous sensor data (light, temperature, atmospheric pressure, etc) in terms of ontologies enriched with semantic meta-data describing the life cycle of the monitored environment.</details></td></tr>

However, the vast majority of web services consume and expose non-RDF data, and it is unlikely that all these services be converted to RDF one day. This is especially true for sensors and other devices in the Web of Things, as most RDF formats are verbose while constrained devices prefer to consume and expose data in concise formats. In this paper, we propose an approach to make these services and things reach semantic interoperability, while letting them the freedom to use their preferred formats. Our approach is rooted in the Web's architectural principles and the linked data principles, and relies on the definition of RDF presentations, which describe the link between RDF graphs and their representations. We introduce the RDF Presentation ontology (RDFP) that can be used to model inputs and outputs of procedures of the new Semantic Sensor Network ontology (SOSA/SSN), and inputData and outputData of interaction patterns of things in the W3C WoT Thing Description ontology. We then propose practical solutions for web agents to be able to discover how a message content can be interpreted as RDF, generated from RDF, or validated, with different Web interaction protocols. </details></td></tr>

context of the Internet of Things (IoT). It provides standards for communication
and interaction with Things in the IoT in order to address
IoT cross-domain and cross-platform interoperability problems and reduce
its fragmentation. WoT uses a formal interface description called
Thing Description (TD) which describes the offerings of Things to allow
the interaction in between Things. Although Things undergo changes
with regard to their physical and/or software components and specifications
during their lifetime, the architectural approach of WoT misses the
lifecycle aspect in the TD. The static nature of the current TD remains
contradictory with the dynamic evolution of Things.
This work researches the lifecycle aspect for Things in the IoT and develops
a lifecycle approach aligned with the WoT paradigm. A study about
the different stakeholders influencing the Things was conducted
to build a role model. These two concepts were combined to develop a
versioning mechanism for a TD through the lifecycle of a Thing.</details></td></tr>

As a type of sensor-actuator system, BCI will integrate novel interfaces that will be fully interoperating with IoT-based systems. An ontological metadata overlay for BCI systems in real-world applications is defined in the BCI Ontology (BCI-O), which formalizes and integrates BCI-domain-specific Sense and Actuation Models along with a novel Context Model for describing any kind of real/virtual environments. This paper presents the design principle of BCI-O's Actuation Model, which integrates SOSA and SAN (IoT-O) axioms for actuations and actuators along with the BCI-O’s Context Model. This model will become relevant in the degree as context-based semantic interoperability will become a core pre-requisite for any context-aware BCI actuation application with real-time collaboration in IoT environments.</details></td></tr>

He has organised several international conferences and workshops and regularly participates in the program committees of relevant conferences and workshops as well as in standardization bodies (W3C, ETSI, OASIS, AENOR) where he collaborates in developing standard ontologies for representing IoT infrastructures and data (e.g., SSN, SAREF).</details>

                    <p>MINES Saint-Étienne, France</p>
                    <details><summary>Maxime Lefrançois is Associate Professor in the Connected-Intelligence team at the École des Mines de Saint-Étienne, France, since 2017.</summary> He prepared his Ph.D. at INRIA Sophia-Antipolis on knowledge representation for the Meaning-Text linguistic theory. Between 2014 and 2017, he was a post-doctoral researcher at École des Mines de Saint-Étienne, and was involved in several bilateral, national, and European projects, including the ITEA2 SEAS project in the context of which he organized a 3 days knowledge engineering workshop with 45 participants, that initiated the development of the SEAS ontology: a modular and versioned ontology built on top of the OGC&W3C SOSA/SSN standard, that consists of simple ontology patterns that can be instantiated for different engineering-related verticals. Maxime is a co-editor of the SOSA/SSN standard, and currently leads a Specialist Task Force (STF 556) at ETSI to inject the SEAS proposals in the ETSI SmartM2M SAREF european standard ontology. He has experience in organizing workshops and tutorials in international events.</details>
