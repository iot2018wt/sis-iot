                    <p>Semantic technology and linked data are perceived by the IoT industry as beneficial technologies to enable semantic interoperability in the fragmented landscape of IoT ecosystems and platforms. However, most industrial practitioners are not familiar with these technologies and are not willing to learn them, as they believe the learning curve is too steep. IoT developers - whether device manufacturers or application developers - ask for rather simple ontologies that are easy to use, and clear guidelines on how to implement semantic web/ linked data solutions, possibly supported by standards development organizations (SDOs), whereas the information they can currently find on the Internet is overwhelming and perceived as not directly applicable. As we have often heard from industrial stakeholders in the past years, there is a clear need to bring semantic technology out of the research labs - where it has been successful so far - to be adopted and applied in operational environments by the IoT industry. Semantic Interoperability is a key issue on the Internet of Things, and several organizations develop ontologies to describe IoT devices and the data they exchange. (W3C SSN, W3C WoT, ETSI SmartM2M, ETSI ISG CIM, BAC.net, KNX, BRICK, â€¦). We encourage these organizations to submit papers about their work.
                    </p>

                    <p>The main objective of this workshop is to bring SDOs and industrial practitioners in IoT with an interest in semantic interoperability together with the strong and successful research community at IoT 2018 to discuss current trends and challenges in Semantic Interoperability and Standardization in IoT. </p>

                    <p>The first edition of SIS-IoT was successfully held at SEMANTiCS 2017 during half a day. Five papers were presented, and there were approximately 25 attendees.</p>

                    <p>The SIS-IoT workshop will be a half-day event with short and full papers, openly peer-reviewed on EasyChair. 
                    The event is meant to be highly interactive, so as to facilitate discussions among participants that could result in future collaborative work. A keynote/invited talk will be planned, and followed by authors presenting their paper. We will ensure sufficient time will be dedicated to questions and answers for each paper. The session will end with a general discussion session to discuss experience related to the topics of the workshop. A panel with experts from the research community and industrial stakeholders may be planned.</p>
